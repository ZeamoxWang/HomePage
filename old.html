      <p class="w3-justify">

        Intrigued by the course Spatial Data Analysis, I started to find an advisor to do some research using spatial data, combining the statistic and AI tools. Then I fortunately got help from Prof. <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/wusensen">Sensen Wu</a> and <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhenhongzju">Zhenhong Du</a> who work at Zhejiang Provincial Laboratory of GIS. As the leader of this research, I initialized it in April 2021 and had finished the writing at the end of 2021. The model we called GNNWR is not complicated but innovative. Some former research cannot combine the artificial intelligence methods with the spatial data analysis very well, however, we put forward a neural network to predict the fluctuation of the coefficients in the regression model when the geographical coordinate varies, which has been proved valid, practical, and efficient.
      </p>

      <img style="width:96%;" src="images/map.png">



      <p class="w3-justify">
        I built this framework on my own, including crawling the house price data in Shenzhen, constructing the network, and analyzing the error. In November 2021, a sophomore schoolmate was introduced by my advisor to help me visualize the data and typeset the paper, and the research progressed very fast. Our research has deeply improved the model GNNWR, not only utilized it in socioeconomic field, but also perfected the examination process.
      </p>

      <img style="width:96%;" src="images/data.png">

      <p class="w3-justify">
        On the 10-fold validation sets (merged), our model GNNWR beats all the traditional models including geographical weighted regression and ordinary least squares regression. Now, I have had finished this research, the paper is published in <i>ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information</i>. Have been researching for about a year, I learned a lot from my advisor and gained a lot from courses like Regression Analysis and Artificial Intelligence. I'm ready to design other neural networks, and process more complex data.

        I have taken some basic courses guiding me to dig deeper into the computer vision realm. Not only some data structure and algorithm courses, but Computer Graphics, Digital Image Processing, and Contemporary Surveying also empower my computer vision career.

      <p class="w3-justify">
        In the summer vacation of 2021, with the support of Prof. <a href="http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/zhpcui/">Zhaopeng Cui</a>, I fortunately attended a group focusing on 3D reconstruction with polarization information. From weekly meetings, everyone in this group gave me warm guidance and instruction, and <b>now our paper is under review for CVPR</b>, for which I made my contributions as the third author. Finally, with the help of polarization images, our model opens up a new task and <b>outperforms all the other depth estimation models</b> as you can see below. This internship significantly helped me manipulate the tools in ML about Linux and PyTorch.

        Our model generates the best prediction on both real and synthesized data with accurate and sharp disparity! Further quantitative comparisons also prove our superiority.
      </p>

      <p class="w3-justify">
        The deep involvement of this research enabled me to learn how to collect research images, prepare group meetings, and reference other models. Moreover, due to my background in computer graphics, I also explored the synthesis pipeline in UE4 to generate our data. As the third author, I provided valuable ideas as well when we modified our model and paper.

      <p class="w3-justify">
        As a student learning GIS tools, statistical principles, and programming techniques, it is so attractive for me to do some geospatial data mining work in the top data mining group. That's why I reached out to Prof. <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/htong">Hanghang Tong</a> at UIUC and want to participate in their cutting-edge research. Fortunately, he offered me this valuable chance to learn how to predict the traffic flow with the help of GCN, GAT, and the Transformer model.
      </p>

      <p class="w3-justify">
        During the summer vacation of 2022, with the support of Prof. <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/htong">Hanghang Tong</a>, I worked with Doctor Baoyu Jing to study METR-LA dataset of Los Angeles. I was inspired by the latest model Autoformer, which used Fourier Analysis to perfectly predict the time series. I realized that this idea might be an impressive breakthrough, and did more theoretical analysis on that. The time lag can be utilized to compensate for the differences of traffic flow phases, and the upstream and downstream relationships could be naturally deduced from the time lags.
      </p>

      <p class="w3-justify">
        In the future, I intend to study more social data, with the help of remote sensing and mobile devices, to benefit our city and its citizens. For example, we can predict house prices more precisely, and we can also use remote sensing images to analyze, visualize, and measure our traffic patterns.

Musics inspires my creativity and cheers me up, helping me learn and study better.</p>
      <p>Although I don't study astronomy anymore, I also engage in stargazing activities. I'd love to wander under the starry night sky in the countryside, take some photos for the eternal mystery. If you go out with me, I could point out constellations, and even calculate the calendar and locate ourselves with the guidance of stars. I believe that will be a fantastic experience.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I'm a ping-pong fan in the school, keeping getting schoolwide prizes for ping-pong games since I was a child. Maybe one day we can have a game of ping-pong~</p>
